This is a very basic 'cutup' of the image given in the instructions from the admissions challenge from Code Fellows. To start off, I simply sliced the image up in Adobe Photoshop, and exported the assets to create a basic html document. I laid out the sliced images to mimic the sample site image. I feel like I could've and should've done much more for this project, such as constructing a site that would mimic all the layout and functionality that the given sample page would have, but the instructions clearly iterate and reiterate to not spend a ton of time on this phase, but to simply do a cutup and lay it our so it opens similarly on a modern browser. 

For the jQuery implementation, I went with adding simple checkbox inputs alongside each ingredient, so that as each one is added in it could be checked off. This was accomplished using input types. Then for the jQuery implementation I added a 'select all' feature that allows all the ingredients to be selected/deselected at once, and also populates the 'select all' button once all ingredients are manually selected.*
