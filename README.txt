This is a very basic 'cutup' of the image given in the instructions from the admissions challenge from Code Fellows. To start off, I simply sliced the image up in Adobe Photoshop, and exported the assets to create a basic html document. I laid out the sliced images to mimic the sample site image. I feel like I could've and should've done much more for this project, such as constructing a site that would mimic all the layout and functionality that the given sample page would have, but the instructions clearly iterate and reiterate to not spend a ton of time on this phase, but to simply do a cutup and lay it our so it opens similarly on a modern browser. Next is the jQuery addition.
